# glyph

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that extracts symbol outlines from your codebase, giving LLM coding agents the context they need.

## What it does

glyph takes a file path glob, recursively discovers matching code files, and parses them using tree-sitter to generate accurate symbol outlines. You control the level of detailâ€”from high-level structure to complete function signatures with visibility modifiers.

## Why glyph?

LLM coding agents work best when they understand your code's structure. glyph bridges that gap by providing clean, multi-file symbol maps that serve as efficient context without overwhelming token limits.
